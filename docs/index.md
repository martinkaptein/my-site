## What I do

I am a very passionate musician and pianist. Currently, I am studying classical music in the Netherlands and regularly give concerts on demand and play in ensembles.

I have a deep interest in different kinds of music and I don't exclude the possibility of composing music at some point in the future.

[Contact me](contact.md) for information about my current repertoire and other requests. Also, feel free to take a look at [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosUIzMUriRTgg60vh3EwCQ) to hear me playing.

Furthermore, I am a technology enthusiast and a software programmer. I build stuff in my free time, some of which you can find on [my Github profile](https://github.com/martinkaptein/). I also create websites and want to build an AI.

In my free time, I write articles on a variety of different topics, which you can find on this site.
