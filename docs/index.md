## IT experience

I am a very big fan of all modern technologies and follow the developements of them closely.

Right now, my favourite programming languages are Javascript and Python. I prefer Javascript, because it's very easy to run on any platform or device, and Python, because of its ease of use a big amount of amazing libraries.

Take a look at [my Github profile](https://github.com/martinkaptein/) to see some of the things I made.

Furthermore, I have some experience with PHP and MySQL as I have run a social network a few years ago. This means that along front-end experience (HTML5) I have also some experience with back-end server configuration (apache).

To round off I know the usual suspects such as yml, git, bash, markdown and a bit of json and ajax.
