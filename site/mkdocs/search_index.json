Additonally, I speak the language of music and some computer languages.\n\n\nEducation and Study\n\n\nIn 2015, finished the general qualification for university entrance (=Abitur) in Germany (Gymnasium). Thus, I have an advanced school-leaving certificate with very good marks.\n\n\nCurrently, I am studying classical music for the subject of classical piano at the ArtEz conservatory in Zwolle, the Netherlands.\nMy main subject teacher is Michail Markov.\n\n\nMy experience in Music\n\n\nMartin Kaptein has a lot of experience in playing solo concerts but also playing in ensembles. Furthermore, Martin Kaptein participates frequently in competitions, masterclasses and festivals in different countries.\n\n\n\n\n2013 International Music Festival of the Isle of Rhodes, Greece\n\n\n2014 Martin was finalist (prix promotion) in Flame Piano Competition in Paris, France\n\n\n2014 International Music Academy in Cremona, Italy\n\n\n2015 Martin won the first price in the St. Cecilia International Pianocompetition in Porto, Portugal\n\n\n2015 and 2016 International Piano Festival in Duzsniky, Poland\n\n\n2016 first price Vught klassiek competition in the Netherlands\n\n\n\n\nIT experience\n\n\nI am a very big fan of all modern technologies and follow the developements of them closely.\n\n\nRight now, my favourite programming languages are Javascript and Python. I prefer Javascript, because it's very easy to run on any platform or device, and Python, because of its ease of use a big amount of amazing libraries.\n\n\nTake a look at \nmy Github profile\n to see some of the things I made.\n\n\nFurthermore, I have some experience with PHP and MySQL as I have run a social network a few years ago. This means that along front-end experience (HTML5) I have also some experience with back-end server configuration (apache).\n\n\nTo round off I know the usual suspects such as yml, git, bash, markdown and a bit of json and ajax.",
